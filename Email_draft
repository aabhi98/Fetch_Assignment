Subject: Clarification and Strategy for Structuring Data

Hi Stake Holder,

I am currently in the process of structuring the JSON data we discussed, and I have drafted an initial relational data model. To proceed effectively, I need some clarifications:
- Could you specify how often the data will be updated and the main source of these updates?
- Are there specific fields in the data that often come incomplete that I should be aware of?
- How do we handle historical data?

Lastly, considering performance and scaling, do you anticipate any specific concerns in these areas, especially with expected data growth?

Looking forward to your insights to optimize and finalize the data structure.

Best regards,
Abhishek Annabathula
